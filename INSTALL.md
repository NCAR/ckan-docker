# DASH Search Local Docker Installation

### Prerequisites  
* A Github Token for reading NCAR private repositories
* A local Docker Installation

### Local Deployment Steps
1. Create a local clone of this repo.
2. Copy the file .env.example to .env
3. Place your Github token value in the file `.github_token` in the repo top-level directory.  It will be ignored by git.
4. Run this command:  `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml build --build-arg TOKEN=$(cat .github_token)`
5. Then run: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up`
6. The nginx service will come up last, at which point you can browse to [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443).
    
### Harvesting Test Records

To fully test out the DASH Search interface, it helps to harvest a small number of records from a test WAF.  This deployment is currently set to use the WAF repo [https://github.com/NCAR/sage-dset-harvest-test-records.git](https://github.com/NCAR/sage-dset-harvest-test-records.git).

At this time, harvesting is done manually after deployment with these steps:
1. Login to the ckan container:  `docker exec -it ckan-docker-ckan-1 /bin/bash`
2. Check that the harvester source was set up correctly by running: `ckan harvester sources`.  You should see one active harvest source.
3. Begin harvesting a small number of records with: `ckan harvester run-test mini-waf`.  

You should then see the harvester log output begin. Refreshing the CKAN Resources page during harvesting should show the already harvested records.
